[![View Estimation of the length scales of wind turbulence on File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/images/matlab-file-exchange.svg)](https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/108944-estimation-of-the-length-scales-of-wind-turbulence)


## Summary

Matlab functions to compute the integral and turbulence length scales in the atmospheric boundary layer.



## Content

The submission file contains:

- The function Lyz.m, which computes the crosswind turbulence lenth scale, either in the y-direction or the z-direction
- The function Ly.m, which computes the integral length scale using the auto-covariance function
- The function fitVK.m which computes the integral length scale using a least-square fit of the von Kármán spectrum to the estimated one
- An example file using Lyz.m Crosswind_turbulence_length_scale.mlx
- An example file using Ly.m and fitVK.mExample_integral_length_scales.mlx
